      <h2 class="title">Hi, I’m Ben.</h2>
      <p class="subtitle subtitle--light">I’m a data analyst and visualization specialist with a designer background.
      </p>

      <p>I started in graphics and communication design to learn essential tools for problem solving, and I was fortunate to work on many projects that solved communication challenges online and in 3D space. Now I'm taking these user-focused design skills and applying them to today's civic issues through geospatial data analysis, data vis, and front-end development tools.
      </p>

      <p>I love working with other specialists to learn their processes and create useful insights, engaging sites, and accessible experiences. If I can be of service to your own projects, please send me a message!
