This sample memo was practice for communicating heavy data-based reasoning in plain language for a non-technical audience. It required advocating for using algorithms to estimate recidivism of applicants to an ex-prisoner job program, a very sensitive topic that balances societal and individual impact. 

[Link to memo](https://bennkeel.github.io/documents/RecidivismMemo.pdf)

The modeling and cost-benefit analysis is based on cleaned data from [Public Policy Analytics textbook, Chapter 7](https://urbanspatial.github.io/PublicPolicyAnalytics/people-based-ml-models-algorithmic-fairness.html) and similar job training programs.

#### My Tools and Techniques
* R Tidyverse Packages and Markdown for data wrangling, modeling, and cost benefit analysis
* Policy research
* Concise, non-technical communication of technical concepts and conclusions
