This sample memo was practice for communicating heavy data-based reasoning in plain language for a non-technical audience. It required advocating for using algorithms to estimate recidivism of applicants to an ex-prisoner job program, a very sensitive topic that balances societal and individual impact. 

The modeling and cost-benefit analysis is based on cleaned data and code samples from [Public Policy Analytics textbook, Chapter 7.](https://urbanspatial.github.io/PublicPolicyAnalytics/people-based-ml-models-algorithmic-fairness.html).
